# SIMoNe: Statistical Inference for Modular Networks

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/jchiquet/simone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jchiquet/simone)
[![AppVeyor build
status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jchiquet/simone?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jchiquet/simone)

> The goals of SIMoNe is to implement methods for the inference of
co-expression networks based on partial correlation
coefficients from either steady-state or time-course
transcriptomic data. Note that with both type of data this
package can deal with samples collected in different
experimental conditions and therefore not identically
distributed. In this particular case, multiple but related
networks are inferred on one simone run.
